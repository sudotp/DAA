This program implements the Job Sequencing with Deadlines problem using a Greedy Algorithm.
The goal is to schedule jobs in such a way that the total profit is maximized, given that each job has a specific deadline and profit and only one job can be executed at a time.

The program defines a Job class that stores each job’s ID, deadline, and profit.
The user enters the number of jobs and their details.
All the jobs are stored in a list.

The jobs are then sorted in descending order of profit, so the most profitable job is considered first.
This sorting step represents the greedy approach, where we always choose the locally optimal option — the job with the highest profit.

Next, we create two lists:
result[] → keeps track of which time slots are occupied,
job_order[] → stores which job is scheduled in each slot.

For each job, the program tries to assign it to the latest available time slot before its deadline.
If a slot is found, the job is placed in that slot, and its profit is added to the total profit.
If no slot is available before the deadline, the job is skipped.

Finally, the program prints the selected job sequence and the maximum total profit obtained.

This approach guarantees that the overall profit is maximized while ensuring that all jobs meet their deadlines.



Complexities :

Time Complexity: O(n²) (due to nested loops)
Space Complexity: O(n)



Viva -
this program uses a greedy algorithm to schedule jobs for maximum profit.
Each job has a deadline and profit, and we sort them by profit in descending order.
Then each job is assigned to the latest available slot before its deadline.
This ensures maximum profit while meeting deadlines.
Time complexity is O(n²), and space complexity is O(n).



OUTPUT EXPLAINED - 
Here, we have 2 jobs:
Job A → Deadline = 2, Profit = 100
Job B → Deadline = 1, Profit = 19

--  How it works:
The program sorts jobs by profit (highest first) → A(100), B(19).
There are 2 available slots (since max deadline = 2).
Job A (highest profit) is assigned first to slot 2.
Job B is then assigned to slot 1 (still free).

So, both jobs can be scheduled within their deadlines.
