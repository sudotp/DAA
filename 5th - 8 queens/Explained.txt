CODE ----

1. N = 8
- Defines the size of the chessboard (8×8) and the total number of queens to place.

2. board = [[0]*N for _ in range(N)]
      -- Creates an 8×8 matrix filled with zeros.
      -- Each cell represents a position on the chessboard.
      -- 1 means a queen is placed; 0 means empty.

3. print_board(board) function
     -- Prints the chessboard in matrix form.
     -- Uses " ".join() to print all elements in each row clearly.

4. is_safe(board, row, col) function
- Checks if placing a queen at (row, col) is safe or not.
- Conditions checked:
    -- Same column: no other queen above in the same column.
    -- Left diagonal: checks upper-left diagonal for another queen.
    -- Right diagonal: checks upper-right diagonal for another queen.
- If any condition fails, returns False; otherwise, returns True.

5. solve(board, row=1) function
    - Uses backtracking to place queens row by row.
    - Starts from the second row, since the first queen is already placed by the user.

6. Base condition – if row == N:
    - If all 8 queens are successfully placed, print the final board configuration and return True.

7. Loop through all columns (for col in range(N)):
    - Tries to place a queen in each column of the current row.
    - Calls is_safe() to check if that position is valid.
    - If safe, places a queen (board[row][col] = 1).

8. Recursive call – solve(board, row + 1)
     -- Moves to the next row to place the next queen.
     -- If the placement leads to a valid solution, it continues.
     -- Otherwise, it backtracks by resetting that position to 0.

9. Backtracking (board[row][col] = 0)
    -- Removes the queen if the current path doesn’t lead to a solution.
    -- This allows the program to try other possible positions.

10. Main Section 
      -- Takes user input using map(int, input().split()) to get the row and column for the first queen.
      -- Subtracts 1 from each (because list indices start from 0).
      -- Places the first queen manually at (r-1, c-1) and calls solve(board).




EXPLAIN ----

This program solves the 8-Queens problem using backtracking.
You first enter where to place the first queen on the board.
Then the program tries to place the remaining queens row by row so that
no two queens attack each other (no same column or diagonal).
If a position is unsafe, it backtracks and tries another.
When all 8 queens are safely placed, the final 8×8 matrix is printed.


Viva --
It uses backtracking — first queen is placed by user,
then the program checks safe spots for others row by row.
If a position causes conflict, it backtracks.
Finally, all 8 queens are placed safely on the board.



OUTPUT -
After placing the first queen, the program tries to place the next queens row by row.
For each new row, it checks if a position is safe — meaning no other queen is in the same column or diagonal.
If a safe spot is found, the queen is placed there.
If not, the program backtracks (removes the last queen) and tries a different column.


The program starts with the first queen at (1,1),
then places all remaining queens safely using backtracking,
and prints a final 8×8 matrix where each 1 marks a queen’s safe position.

Here:

1 → Queen placed.

0 → Empty cell.

No two 1s are in the same row, column, or diagonal.
